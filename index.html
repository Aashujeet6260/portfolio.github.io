					<li id="lol2">Netflix Clone</li>
					<br>
					<p>For the Netflix Frontend Clone project, I developed a responsive and visually appealing website
						that closely mimics the user interface of Netflix. The project was crafted using only HTML and
						CSS, focusing on replicating key design elements to provide an authentic user experience.
						The layout features a dynamic homepage with a sleek header that includes the Netflix logo,
						navigation links, and a sign-in button. Below the header, there are multiple sections showcasing
						movie posters in horizontally scrollable carousels, giving the user an interactive feel akin to
						Netflixâ€™s popular content browsing experience. The CSS styling was meticulously done to ensure
						the grid structure and alignment of images maintained a polished, clean look.I also utilized CSS
						Flexbox and Grid to achieve responsiveness, allowing the website to adjust seamlessly to
						different screen sizes, ensuring usability across devices like laptops, tablets, and
						smartphones. The project does not include JavaScript, meaning all the interactions and
						animations are purely CSS-driven. Through media queries, the website adapts to varying
						resolutions while maintaining a visually consistent design.
					</p>
					<li id="lol2">Spotifly Clone</li>
					<br>
					<p>
						For my Spotify Front-End Clone project, I aimed to recreate the user interface of Spotify using
						only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The project focuses on delivering a visually appealing and fully
						responsive design that mimics the look and feel of the original Spotify platform.
						I used **HTML** to structure the content, carefully organizing the page layout to resemble
						Spotify's homepage and key features. This includes the navigation bar, playlists section, song
						cards, and media player controls. The **CSS** styling was instrumental in making the clone
						visually similar to Spotify. I employed modern CSS techniques such as Flexbox and Grid to create
						a fluid layout that adjusts seamlessly across various screen sizes, ensuring the website's
						responsiveness.
						For the interactive features, I integrated **JavaScript** to handle dynamic behavior. While the
						clone doesn't have a backend to stream music, JavaScript was used to simulate functions like the
						play/pause button, song selection, and volume controls. Additionally, transitions and animations
						were incorporated for a more polished and engaging user experience.
						The project showcases my front-end development skills and my ability to recreate complex UIs
						using fundamental web technologies. It's an excellent demonstration of how design and
						functionality can be achieved with a minimal tech stack.

					<li id="lol2">Ecommerce Website</li>
					<br>
					<p>
						convert in point for readme github For my E-commerce website project, I utilized PHP, XAMPP,
						HTML, and CSS to develop a user-friendly online shopping platform. The website features a
						comprehensive product catalog where users can browse through items, view detailed product
						descriptions, and check prices. I implemented a secure user authentication system, enabling
						customers to register, log in, and manage their profiles seamlessly. The shopping cart
						functionality allows users to add items to their cart, review their selections, and proceed with
						checkout. All user data, product listings, and order information are managed using a MySQL
						database integrated through XAMPP. Additionally, I applied custom CSS to ensure the site is
						responsive, providing a smooth browsing experience on both desktop and mobile devices. This
						project allowed me to enhance my skills in both frontend and backend development, offering a
						full-stack solution for an E-commerce platform.
